Call Center Model

Description
In call center there ara three levels of employees:

respondent
manager
director.

An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director.

Design the classes and data structures for solution this problem.
Implement a method DispatchCall() which assigns a call to the first available employee.
